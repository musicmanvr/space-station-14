      I rigged the area where our stuff's at to be a toasty thousand K.
      You know how to drain it when we need it out.

      AME controller needs LV power and an HV wire to output to. Check the area with a crowbar if you aren't sure.
      There should be an empty room next to where you found this, that room's wired for the AME.
      You can put an AME anywhere if you can get the wires to it, though.
      3x3 grid of AME parts, multitool them to unpack. Be careful not to 'trap' anything.
      AME controller adjacent horizontally or vertically (not diagonally) to any point.
      With only 1 core (what a 3x3 grid will get you), don't turn it up above 2.
      The golden rule is 2 injection for every 1 core. You can go lower to save fuel.
      Higher will burn the engine out and eventually make it explode. Don't.
      Don't forget to refuel it, it tends to stop at the worst possible time.

book-text-assault-info = Greetings, Trooper, and thank you for your purchase.
      This bundle comes with equipment suited for more direct engagement with enemies you may face on the battlefield.
      Your primary weapon is the C-20r Submachine Gun with three backup magazines, a reliable favorite of many Operatives past and present.
      For close-range encounters, your purchase includes an energy sword, a loud yet powerful weapon that slices through unarmored targets with ease.
      While holding the sword, you may also reflect projectiles that come your way, with a higher chance if the projectile is a laser.

      The rest of your kit consists of the following items:

      - Agent ID Card
      Tap another ID card with your agent ID to steal their access. This card is also capable of chameleon technology, allowing you to disguise yourself as anyone you desire.
      Be aware that the agent ID does not disguise your voice, only your name and job.

      - Blood Red Magboots
      Our latest generation of Cybersun Magboots contains a jetpack, air tank, and no-slip shoes all in one tight package.
      Activate the boots to prevent yourself from slipping and also magnetize yourself to the floor, at the cost of a slight amount of agility.
      While the boots can be used as an oxygen source, this is not recommended due to its small size.

      - Health Stimulant
      Contains a powerful stimulant that can heal your wounds. If you can't make it to your medic, inject this stimulant to stay in the fight.

      As an assault operative, your job is important. Make sure to listen to your Commander...

      Aside from following your Commander's orders, assault agents should:

      - Take the front line against NanoTrasen employees; kill any that get in your way.
      - Find the captain with your pinpointer, then kill or incapacitate him to get the nuclear disk.
      - Locate the nuclear warhead, anchor it to a suitable floor.
      - Activate the nuclear warhead using the disk and code.
      - Take out the disc, then prepare for the rest of the station's assault.
      - Escape. OR Ensure the bomb detonates after 240 seconds.

      No nuclear operation ever goes perfectly; a loose variable could ruin your plans, you could get stunned and arrested, or the clown could steal your gun.
      Regardless of the outcome of your mission, remember that every strike against NanoTrasen is experience earned. Learn from your mistakes, rise again, and fight.

      As always, remember...

      DEATH TO NANOTRASEN!!!

book-text-heavy-info = Greetings, Juggernaut, and thank you for your purchase.
      This bundle carries our infamous Juggernaut suit, the Bulldog automatic shotgun, and some extra goodies.
      The bulldog is capable of eviscerating anyone that dares stand in front of you and comes with two lethal drums and a non-lethal drum for disabling pesky opponents.
      Your melee option is a small energy dagger disguised as a pen. It's weak, but better than nothing.

      Additional equipment is as follows:

      - Blood Red Magboots
      Our latest generation of Cybersun Magboots contains a jetpack, air tank, and no-slip shoes all in one tight package.
      Activate the boots to prevent yourself from slipping and also magnetize yourself to the floor, at the cost of a slight amount of agility.
      While the boots can be used as an oxygen source, this is not recommended due to its small size.

      - EMP Implanter
      Injecting yourself with this implanter will give you the ability to send out a short-range EMP shockwave up to three times.
      This shockwave disables batons, laser rifles, disablers, and all manner of energy-powered weaponry.
      If you find yourself about to be taken down by a lowly officer with a stun baton, press your panic button and show them your handshake!

      As a heavy weapons operative, your job is quite important. Make sure to listen to your Commander...

      Aside from following your Commander's orders, heavy agents should:

      - Stick with another operative; you're slow with your armor.
      - Conserve ammo; let the rest of your squad handle the dirty work unless absolutely necessary.
      - Help secure the disk, then find a good place to bunker down with the nuclear warhead.
      - Hold the line. Defend your team at all costs; you are their first line of defense!
      - Escape. OR Ensure the bomb detonates after 240 seconds.

      No nuclear operation ever goes perfectly; a loose variable could ruin your plans; you could be left behind due to your speed; or you could run out of ammo at the worst time.
      Regardless of the outcome of your mission, remember that every strike against NanoTrasen is experience earned. Learn from your mistakes, rise again, and fight.

      As always, remember...

      DEATH TO NANOTRASEN!!!

      "YOU SHALL NOT PASS! NOT WHILE I STILL STAND!!!"

book-text-demolitions-info = Greetings, Pyro, and thank you for your purchase.
      Let's cut the serious talk here; this bundle is perhaps the single most dangerous thing that you can purchase from us. We're not joking.
      A grenade launcher that holds three grenades, eight extra in your bag, and eight plastic explosives to fulfill your destructive desires.
      And... a little energy dagger in case you don't want to decimate your entire team fighting close range.

      It is VERY important to understand that this kit requires the upost of caution, patience, and trigger discipline. One wrong move can destroy your entire team.
      By selecting this kit, you've knowingly signed yourself up for the trip of a lifetime; it just so happens to be one way.
      Be advised that explosive damage can detonate your stowed grenades; if this happens, you're dead.

      Aside from the present danger of the China Lake, here are some words of advice:

      - Blast grenades excel at punching holes and decimating single targets, while frag grenades make a massive fireball. The China Lake comes preloaded with frags.
      - Plastic explosives have a timer you can adjust, and can be stuck to walls for a smooth entry!
      - C4 can be affixed to walls to do maximum damage and makes for an excellent entry tool despite the noise.
      - While C4 can be thrown like a grenade, it's ill advised due to the sizeable notice your target is given.
      - Do not hit your teammates.

      Included in the kit is a pAI friend for the therapy we don't give you.

      Aside from following your Commander's orders, demolition agents should:

      - Prioritize gaining forceful entry into areas of the station.
      - Use C4 on walls to make entryways for your squad.
      - If you wish, use blast grenades to decompress rooms, leaving anyone without a spacesuit in a vulnurable position.
      - Make your shots count, focus on large groups, and take advantage of the fact that explosions have a large radius.
      - Don't worry if you accidentally mess up the mission; mistakes happen.
      - If you live long enough, Escape. OR Ensure the bomb detonates after 240 seconds, you included.

      No nuclear operation ever goes perfectly; a loose variable could ruin your plans, you could detonate yourself and your team, or you could catch a rocket in the face.
      Regardless of the outcome of your mission, remember that every strike against NanoTrasen is experience earned. Learn from your mistakes, rise again, and fight.

      As always, remember...

      DEATH TO NANOTRASEN!!!

      "What makes me a good demolitionist? Well, if I were a bad de- *BOOM*"

book-text-engineer-info = Greetings, Engineer, and thank you for your purchase.
      As an engineer, you'll be pulling the weight of most of your team when it comes to infiltration, defense, and special tactics.
      Your weapon loadout consists of a Hristov sniper rifle, twenty extra bullets, and a variety of tools.
      The Hristov shoots slow, but packs a massive punch when landing a shot.

      Your tools consist of:

      - Toolset
      A good old set of tools. Comes with a syndicate gas mask, combat gloves, and a full set of basic tools.
      That's it, just a set of tools to do things the old fashioned way!
      Don't know how to hack? The present is a great time to learn, just check your guidebook for more.

      - Blood Red Magboots
      Our latest generation of Cybersun Magboots contains a jetpack, air tank, and no-slip shoes all in one tight package.
      Activate the boots to prevent yourself from slipping and also magnetize yourself to the floor, at the cost of a slight amount of agility.
      While the boots can be used as an oxygen source, this is not recommended due to its small size.

      - Composition C4
      Plastic explosives are any breacher's best friend, you get three plastic explosives to use, make em' count.
      Arm the bomb to begin the countdown, don't stand next to it once it hits zero!
      Tap the C4 to a wall to stick it on!

      - Cryptographic Sequencer
      The almighty, allpowerful EMAG. This business card sized tool can hack open doors, unlock lockers, and break into just about anything.
      It comes with three charges that recharge over time each taking around ninety seconds.
      Don't underestimate the power of your EMAG. If you find a cyborg, decomission them, then open their panel with a screwdriver. Use your EMAG to make it alligned with you!
      There are various effects to find when experimenting with the sequencer, try it on anything you can find.

      - Radio Jammer
      This bad boy jams communications across nearly the entire station, including your own!
      If you want to sew mass panic, jam the radio and quietly break in. By the time the crew realize you're there, it's too late.
      To be even extra devious, sabotage the communications array WHILE having your jammer on.

      - Jaws of Life
      Normally used for prying open stuck doors, this powerful set of hydraulic jaws is capable of forcing open nearly any door on the station.
      It'll take you some time to pry, but the jaws are more than capable of forcing open doors you don't have access to.
      Keep in mind that the hydraulic noise is very distinct and loud, make sure you jam communications so that nobody can cry for help!
      Bolted doors cannot be forced, bust out your tools and get to hacking.

      The engineer is reliable, beloved, and always in high demand among Operative squads.

      Aside from following your Commander's orders, engineer agents should:

      - Prioritize gaining forceful entry into areas of the station.
      - Hack doors using your EMAG or blow right through with C4!
      - Don't let people mess with you, you're a very important member of the squad.
      - Jam the radio communications to delay security response time, masking your exact location.
      - Use your jaws of life to pry open doors if your EMAG isn't ready.
      - Escape. OR Ensure the bomb detonates after 240 seconds.

      No nuclear operation ever goes perfectly; a loose variable could ruin your plans, you could bolt every door to your destination, or you could forget your tools.
      Regardless of the outcome of your mission, remember that every strike against NanoTrasen is experience earned. Learn from your mistakes, rise again, and fight.

      As always, remember...

      DEATH TO NANOTRASEN!!!
